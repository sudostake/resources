## Document Index & Sources of Truth
- Status, timelines, and execution steps — Source of truth: sudostake-roadmap-near-mvp.md
  - Progress reports summarize but defer to the roadmap for dates/scope.
- Product spec and flows — Source of truth: PERSONAS_AND_FLOWS.md
  - System rules, entities/states, user flows, liquidation order, and KPIs.
- Milestone M1 details — Source of truth: sudostake_m1_progress.md

- Risk register — Source of truth: SUDOSTAKE_RISK_REGISTER.md

Consistency rules for edits
- Terms: use “global Vault contract”, “code-hash registry”, “counter-offers (amount-only)”, “feature flags”.
- Interfaces: prefer ascii hyphens in text; keep exact method names for code (ft_transfer_call, ft_on_transfer).
- When changing scope, rules, or dates: update the source-of-truth doc first, then reflect in summaries.
