# SudoStake â€” Progress Report 2

Date: 2025-09-23  â€¢  Roadmap: [sudostake-roadmap-near-mvp.md](./sudostake-roadmap-near-mvp.md)

> The roadmap remains the authoritative source for scope, dates, and dependencies.

## Summary
- M1 functionally complete ahead of the 2025-09-30 target; full testnet lifecycle validated.
- Counter-offers (amount-only) deferred without affecting MVP scope.
- near-sdk-rs PR #1369 merged, clearing the blocker for the optimized factory path in M2.

## Status
- **Milestone 1 â€” âœ… Delivered (Target 2025-09-30):** Wallet connect, vault dashboard, staking management, loan lifecycle, liquidation flow, lender marketplace all confirmed on testnet.
- **Counter-offers:** Deferred to post-M1 backlog; marketplace live without it.
- **Milestone 2 â€” ðŸš§ In preparation (Target 2025-11-15):** Optimized path now unblocked; planning feature flag rollout and size/cost baselines.

## Risks
- None blocking M1 completion.
- M2 work will operate behind feature flags to limit regressions as global vault deployment advances.

## Next (2 Weeks)
- Kick off optimized factory path work: global vault deployment, code-hash registry, size/cost reporting.
- Maintain Nov 1 readiness checkpoint; fallback plan documented if optimizations slip.
