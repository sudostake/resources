# SudoStake Action Plan â€” NEAR MVP & Launch

## Quick View (as of 2025-10-07)
- **Step 1 â€” Testnet Flow Validation:** Code-complete. Credentialed rehearsal with Firebase Admin + RPC keys remains.
- **Step 2 â€” Shared Vault Deployment:** Design review booked for 2025-10-14; implementation has not started.
- **Steps 3â€“6:** Mainnet candidate â†’ beta stabilization â†’ launch wave 1 â†’ launch wave 2. Each depends on the shared vault path landing first.

## Current Focus (Next 2 Weeks)
- Run the full rehearsal for Step 1 and capture any fixes.
- Finalize the shared vault registry design and baseline current factory costs.
- Draft the build + artifact publishing script for the shared vault.
- Lock the migration/rehearsal plan so Step 2 work can start immediately after the design review.

## Watchlist
- **High mint fee (~10â€¯NEAR):** stays until Step 2 ships; keep optimization top priority.
- **Shared vault migration:** requires rehearsals plus rollback tooling.
- **Firebase/Vercel availability:** failures block indexing; monitor service health during rehearsal.

## Step-by-Step Plan

### Step 1 â€” Testnet Flow Validation (Target 2025-09-30)
- Status: âœ… Code ready, ðŸ”„ rehearsal outstanding.
- Finish: run mint â†’ liquidation with real credentials, log outcomes, patch docs as needed.

### Step 2 â€” Shared Vault Deployment (Target 2025-11-15)
- Status: ðŸ•“ Pending design approval.
- Key actions:
  - Approve registry design (10 Oct review) & baseline deploy costs.
  - Implement registry + shared artifact, update factory, web, and agent configs.
  - Rehearse migration (mint â†’ migrate â†’ verify) and publish migration/rollback notes.

### Step 3 â€” Mainnet Candidate Release (Target 2025-11-30)
- Promote optimized artifacts to a monitored mainnet candidate and invite a closed beta cohort.

### Step 4 â€” Beta Stabilization (Target 2025-12-20)
- Hit reliability goals, tighten UX copy, and expand support playbooks while beta remains gated.

### Step 5 â€” Mainnet Launch Wave 1 (Target 2026-03-31)
- Limited-access launch with dashboards, alerts, and incident response tooling live.

### Step 6 â€” Mainnet Launch Wave 2 & Scale (Target 2026-06-30)
- Broader access plus scalability and observability tuning for sustained operation.
