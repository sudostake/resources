# SudoStake â€” Progress Report 3

Date: 2025-09-26  â€¢  Roadmap: [sudostake-roadmap-near-mvp.md](./sudostake-roadmap-near-mvp.md)

> The roadmap remains the source of truth for dates, scope, and dependencies.

## Summary
- M1 closed on 2025-09-23 (ahead of target) with full testnet validation, including liquidation rehearsals.
- M2 (optimized path) underway; near-sdk-rs PR #1369 merged, enabling global vault deployment work.
- Active focus: code-hash registry, WASM size reduction, and controlled rollout behind feature flags.

## Status
- **Milestone 1 â€” âœ… Delivered:** End-to-end flows (mint â†’ delegate â†’ request â†’ accept â†’ repay â†’ liquidation â†’ claims) confirmed; marketplace live; counter-offers deferred.
- **Milestone 2 â€” ðŸš§ In progress (Target 2025-11-15):**
  - Tasks: code-hash registry, WASM reductions, global vault deployment with view compatibility, migration guide, size/cost report, extended E2E tests.
  - Checkpoint: Nov 1 readiness review; fallback documented but not expected.

## Risks
- **Global vault migration:** Use feature flags, maintain view compatibility, and run dedicated migration tests.
- **Optimization regressions:** Expand integration tests, lock event schemas, and monitor candidate deployments.

## Next (2 Weeks)
- Finalize code-hash registry and baseline size metrics (draft report underway).
- Ship feature flags and deploy a candidate global vault to testnet.
- Draft the migration guide and run a rehearsal with a small lender/borrower cohort.
