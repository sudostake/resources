# LEAN CANVAS — SudoStake (Chain‑Agnostic)

One‑liner
- Borrow against staked assets without unbonding. User‑owned vaults, deterministic flows, simple integrations.

1) Problem
- Stakers face unbonding delays/penalties or risky wrappers/custody.
- Lenders lack a simple, non‑custodial path to deploy capital against productive collateral.

2) Customer Segments
- Stakers/validators seeking liquidity without unbonding.
- Lenders/treasuries seeking secured stablecoin yield.
- Wallets/agents/dApps embedding “Borrow against stake.”

3) Unique Value Proposition
- Turn staked assets into usable collateral — no unbonding, no custodians, simple rules.
- User‑owned vaults (not pooled); deterministic, oracle‑minimized flow; composable events/interfaces.

4) Solution
- Vaults: mint user‑owned smart vault (one‑time fee) to manage stake/balances.
- Borrow/Lend: borrower posts terms; lender accepts via token transfer + message.
- Liquidation: anyone can trigger post‑deadline; priority‑ordered repayment.
- Integrations: structured events and stable interfaces for wallets/agents.

5) Channels
- Web app; agent/wallet integrations; validator/wallet/community partnerships.

6) Revenue Streams
- Configurable vault creation fee; optional validator/operator commissions.

7) Cost Structure
- Protocol engineering/audits/maintenance; frontend/agent/indexing; deploy/monitoring/support.

8) Key Metrics
- Value staked; vaults created/active; loan volume, repayment rate, time‑to‑fund; lender liquidity; integrations.

9) Unfair Advantage
- Oracle‑minimized deterministic design; user‑owned vaults (no pooled custody); modular adapters for staking/tokens/events.
