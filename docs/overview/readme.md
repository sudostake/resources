## Update Playbook
- Begin with the [Contributing Guide](../team/contributing.md) for terminology, scope order, and review checklist.
- Change the source-of-truth document first, then sync summaries or collateral.
- Record action-plan updates, sequencing adjustments, and risk changes in the relevant execution docs before updating briefs.
- Log stale files or follow-ups in the documentation inventory so maintenance owners can track them.
- Run `scripts/check-links.sh` after major restructures.
