# Investor & Partner Brief — SudoStake on NEAR

## At a Glance
- **Model:** Borrow against staked NEAR. Oracle-less, user-owned vaults with deterministic liquidation.
- **Traction:** Prior chain ~231 vaults; Milestone 1 — Web Testnet Feature-Complete delivered on 2025-09-23.
- **Focus:** Milestone 2 — Factory Optimization targeting 2025-11-15 for the global vault rollout (behind feature flags).

## Why It Matters
- Unlock capital for stakers without unbonding or custodians.
- Transparent, deterministic recovery for lenders (no price oracles).
- NEAR fit: predictable epochs, native USDC, and growing intents/agents.

## Current Milestones
- **Milestone 1 — Web Testnet Feature-Complete:** Delivered 2025-09-23.
- **Milestone 2 — Factory Optimization:** Target 2025-11-15; introduces the code-hash registry, size/cost reporting, and global vault rollout.
- **Next Gates:** 2025-10-07 roadmap review; 2025-11-01 readiness checkpoint for Milestone 2.

## Key Metrics (Q3 2025)
- 231 historical vaults (prior chain benchmark).
- Testnet validated: request → accept → repay → liquidation; marketplace live.
- Counter-offers (amount-only) staged after Milestone 1 completion.

## Partner Opportunities
- Security reviewers, indexers, wallet/agent distribution partners.
- Early lenders/validators for beta cohorts.
- Observatory/analytics collaborations for EVENT_JSON ingestion.
