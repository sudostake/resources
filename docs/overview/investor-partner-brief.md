# Investor & Partner Brief — SudoStake on NEAR

Use this brief when aligning investors and partners on traction, roadmap checkpoints, and the core diligence packet.

## Investment Highlights
- **Model:** Native staking-backed credit. Borrow USDC against staked NEAR without unbonding or custodians; lenders operate in isolated, oracle-free deals.
- **Validation:** ~231 vaults on the prior chain; Step 1 — Testnet Flow Validation shipped on 2025-09-23 with full lifecycle coverage.
- **Momentum:** Step 2 — Shared Vault Deployment (target 2025-11-15) will introduce the shared vault path implemented directly in the factory and slash vault deployment costs.

## Why It Matters
- Unlock capital for stakers without unbonding or custodians.
- Transparent, deterministic recovery for lenders (no price oracles).
- NEAR fit: predictable epochs, native USDC, and growing intents/agents.

## Execution Outlook
- **Step 1 — Testnet Flow Validation:** Delivered 2025-09-23.
- **Step 2 — Shared Vault Deployment:** Target 2025-11-15; introduces the code-hash registry, reference vault deployment, and size/cost reporting.
- **Next Gates:** 2025-10-07 roadmap review; 2025-11-01 readiness checkpoint validating optimized-path readiness.

## Proof Points (Q3 2025)
- 231 historical vaults (prior chain benchmark) demonstrate demand for staked-collateral credit.
- NEAR testnet covers the entire lifecycle today: request → accept → repay → liquidation, surfaced through the marketplace and AI agent.
- Counter-offers (amount-only) captured in backlog and scoped for the post-optimization roadmap.
