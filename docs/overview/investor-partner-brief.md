# Investor & Partner Brief — SudoStake on NEAR

## At a Glance
- **Model:** Borrow against staked NEAR with user-owned, oracle-free vaults.
- **Traction:** ~231 vaults on the prior chain; Milestone 1 — Web Testnet Feature-Complete shipped on 2025-09-23.
- **Focus:** Milestone 2 — Factory Optimization (target 2025-11-15) to launch the shared vault path behind feature flags.

## Why It Matters
- Unlock capital for stakers without unbonding or custodians.
- Transparent, deterministic recovery for lenders (no price oracles).
- NEAR fit: predictable epochs, native USDC, and growing intents/agents.

## Current Milestones
- **Milestone 1 — Web Testnet Feature-Complete:** Delivered 2025-09-23.
- **Milestone 2 — Factory Optimization:** Target 2025-11-15; introduces the code-hash registry, size/cost reporting, and global vault rollout.
- **Next Gates:** 2025-10-07 roadmap review; 2025-11-01 readiness checkpoint for Milestone 2.

## Key Metrics (Q3 2025)
- 231 historical vaults (prior chain benchmark).
- Testnet flows validated end to end: request → accept → repay → liquidation, marketplace live.
- Counter-offers (amount-only) queued for follow-up after Milestone 1.

## Partner Opportunities
- Security reviewers, indexers, and wallet or agent distribution partners.
- Early lenders and validator cohorts for beta launches.
- Analytics collaborators to stream `EVENT_JSON` data.
