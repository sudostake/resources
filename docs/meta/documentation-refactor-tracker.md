# SudoStake Documentation Refactor — Execution Tracker

_Current coverage: Muhammed Ali (acting docs lead) owns every phase until collaborators onboard._

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Scope Highlights | Owner | Target Completion | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 0 — Alignment | Confirm scope, publish tracker, outline guardrails. | Muhammed Ali | 2025-10-01 | In progress | Cadence and owner gaps captured below. |
| Phase 1 — Navigation | Create `docs/` tree, relocate readme.md, update inventory, add link checks. | Muhammed Ali | 2025-10-08 | Completed | Folder migration live; use `scripts/check-links.sh` after future moves. |
| Phase 2 — Standardization | Apply front matter, add review blocks, publish templates. | Muhammed Ali | 2025-10-15 | Completed | Templates applied across docs; `scripts/check-links.sh` covers link verification. |
| Phase 3 — Role Guides | Build audience landing pages and cross-links. | Muhammed Ali | 2025-10-29 | In progress | Investor, builder, and community briefs drafted; continue adding SME inputs. |
| Phase 4 — Depth & Assets | Enrich technical refs, diagrams, and runbooks. | Muhammed Ali | 2025-11-12 | Planned | Coordinate with future protocol partner. |
| Phase 5 — Maintenance | Launch changelog, review cadence, update ceremony doc. | Muhammed Ali | 2025-11-22 | Planned | Becomes ongoing once established. |

## Owner & Cadence Matrix

| Audience Cluster | Primary Docs | Interim Owner | Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Investors & VCs | `overview/investor-partner-brief.md`, `overview/project-one-pager-sudostake-near.md`, `overview/pitch-deck-sudostake-near.md` | Muhammed Ali | Bi-weekly during fundraising; hand off once GTM lead joins. |
| Researchers & Technical Reviewers | `systems/sudostake-core-infra-on-near.md`, `execution/sudostake-risk-register.md`, technical appendices | Muhammed Ali | Review at execution checkpoints; recruit protocol partner post-alignment. |
| Ecosystem Partners & Builders | `overview/builder-integration-guide.md`, roadmap snapshots, API references | Muhammed Ali | Review before each integration wave; transition to partner engineering when staffed. |
| Community & Prospective Users | `overview/community-snapshot.md`, progress reports, FAQs | Muhammed Ali | Align with progress reports; communicate monthly at minimum. |
| Contributors & Internal Stakeholders | Contributing guide, inventory, tracker, future changelog | Muhammed Ali | Bi-weekly self-review plus quarterly ceremony placeholder. |

## Cadence Commitments

- **Weekly solo review (15 min):** Muhammed Ali records status against tracker checkpoints; capture blockers in tracker notes.
- **Bi-weekly planning block:** Reassess upcoming deliverables; identify roles to recruit as alignment improves.
- **Quarterly documentation review:** Validate sources of truth, close stale follow-ups in `documentation-inventory.md`, and log retrospective in upcoming changelog.

## Immediate Actions (Phase 0)

1. Confirm personal availability for each phase deliverable; document bandwidth risks in the tracker by 2025-09-30.
2. Announce the completed folder migration and point contributors to `scripts/check-links.sh` for ongoing verification.
3. Circulate the front matter and progress-report templates for feedback; prep audience landing pages for Phase 3 onboarding.

## Change Log Placeholder

- 2025-09-29 — Initial tracker drafted; awaiting owner confirmations.
