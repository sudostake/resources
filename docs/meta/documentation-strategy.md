# SudoStake Documentation Strategy

## Purpose
- Align every contributor on how we plan, draft, and maintain the documentation set.
- Clarify the audiences we serve and the information priorities each requires.
- Provide tone, structure, and maintenance guardrails before the wider refactor.

## Strategic Objectives
1. Present an investor-ready narrative anchored in roadmap commitments and traction.
2. Publish technically rigorous content for researchers, validators, and integrators.
3. Offer quick onboarding paths for partners, community members, and prospective users.
4. Keep a single source of truth for scope, requirements, and execution while syncing all summaries to it.

## Primary Audiences & Top Questions
| Audience | Goals | Key Questions We Must Answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Investors & VCs | Evaluate opportunity, team, and execution readiness. | What problem are we solving, what is the market, what traction have we achieved, what steps are next, how do we de-risk? |
| Researchers & Technical Reviewers | Assess protocol design, risk, and integration feasibility. | How does the architecture work, what assumptions underpin it, how do we mitigate risk, how do contracts interact? |
| Ecosystem Partners & Builders | Decide whether to integrate or collaborate. | What are the partner touchpoints, what tooling or APIs exist, what is the rollout plan, who manages which components? |
| Community & Prospective Users | Understand SudoStake’s value proposition and status. | Why does this matter to them, what benefits are live or upcoming, how can they follow progress? |

## Tone & Voice
- Write with confident, plain language; layer in technical depth as needed.
- Define new terminology inline and cross-link to a glossary once created.
- Reference the authoritative source whenever summarizing scope, rules, or timelines.

## Structural Guidelines (Pre-Refactor)
- Add front matter to every document: Purpose, Owner, Last Updated (ISO date), Primary Audience(s).
- Structure sections as summary → detail → references; add “Related Documents” and “Next Review” when useful.
- Use tables, diagrams, and bullets for complex concepts; avoid heavy paragraphs.

## Maintenance Expectations
- Run a quarterly documentation review led by Product/Ops; log outcomes here or in a future changelog.
- Review roadmap, risk register, and progress reports monthly for alignment.
- Surface major revisions through commit history and progress reports.

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Share the documentation inventory and information architecture plan for sign-off.
2. Assign owners per audience cluster to manage ongoing updates.
3. Approve folder migrations and the order of link updates.
4. Prioritize deeper refreshes (infra overview, risk register, roadmap summaries) after alignment.

Revisit this strategy once the Phase 2 information architecture proposal is in place to confirm it still holds.
