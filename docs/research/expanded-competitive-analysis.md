# SudoStake Competitive Analysis

Use this analysis when positioning SudoStake against adjacent lending models for investors or ecosystem partners.

## Snapshot
- **Positioning:** Native staking-backed credit; vaults remain user-owned collateral with deterministic settlement.
- **One-liner:** Stakers secure stablecoin working capital through direct lender offersâ€”no price oracles required.
- **Contact:** hello@sudostake.com

## Target Users
- **Borrowers (stakers/validators):** Unlock liquidity without surrendering validator keys or unstaking.
- **Lenders (USDC suppliers):** Access isolated, on-chain deals with transparent repayment paths.

## Differentiators
| Attribute | SudoStake | Pooled MM | CDP Stablecoin | Custodial Credit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Collateral model | User-owned vault; time-bound credit | Shared liquidity pool | Overcollateralized mint | Off-chain or custodial |
| Oracle reliance | None (deterministic liquidation) | High | High | Off-chain |
| Liquidation flow | Manual trigger, fixed order | Pool-driven | Protocol-driven | Contractual |
| Transparency | EVENT_JSON logs; view calls | Depends on pool | Varies | Limited |

## When to Choose What
- **SudoStake:** Need working capital without losing validator control; value predictable timelines and transparent logs.
- **Pooled Market Makers:** Need instant, large ticket sizes and accept pooled or oracle risk.
- **CDP Stablecoins:** Prefer self-minting with peg/oracle exposure and higher collateral ratios.
- **Custodial Credit:** Require fiat rails, KYC, or flexible off-chain terms.
