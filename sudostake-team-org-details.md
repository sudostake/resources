# SudoStake — Team & Org Details

One‑liner: Native staking, composable credit.
Current focus: Archway (active); expanding to NEAR (Rust/NEAR‑SDK) with Next.js/React frontend.

TL;DR
- Open‑source, non‑custodial protocol (Vaults; no price oracles).
- Solo‑maintained by Muhammed Ali; contributors via GitHub.
- Proven on Archway (~231 vaults). NEAR‑native MVP in progress.
- Security: reproducible builds, signed releases, integration tests; audit + bounty pre‑scale.

- Model: Public roadmap/issues; PR‑driven; lightweight contributor agreements as needed

2) Core Team & Roles
- Muhammed Ali — Founder/Maintainer/Lead Protocol Engineer
  - Focus: Protocol architecture; Rust smart contracts (NEAR‑SDK, prior CosmWasm); CI/CD; product/roadmap.
  - Highlights: oracle‑less vault credit flows; reproducible WASM builds; near‑workspaces tests; Cosmos→NEAR port; governance migration plan (solo → 2‑of‑3 multisig when ≥2 maintainers).
- Open Contributors (recruiting): contracts, frontend, DevOps, docs/community. Participate via issues/PRs; bounties posted as funding permits.

3) Advisors & Partners
- Advisors: none formal; informal ecosystem feedback ongoing.
- Security reviewers: external Rust/NEAR reviewers per milestone (vendor TBD).
- Validator partners: evaluating; none finalized.

4) Organization
- Operating: solo maintainer + open‑source PRs/issues.
- Governance: solo today → 2‑of‑3 multisig when ≥2 maintainers; on‑chain params where feasible.
- Cadence: public backlog/roadmap; milestone release notes.
- Licensing: open‑source; CLAs possible for significant contributions.

5) Legal & Compliance
- Entity: none yet; incorporation planned.
- Posture: non‑custodial software; no client funds/fiat handling.
- Data: minimal; privacy‑preserving analytics if added.
- Jurisdiction: evaluating; will update on registration.

6) Security Practices
- Current: reproducible builds (cargo‑near, GitHub Actions); GPG‑signed commits/tags; protected branches; review‑required PRs; unit/integration tests (near‑workspaces) for vault lifecycle/settlement/liquidation; MEV‑aware design.
- Planned: third‑party audit; public bug bounty; expanded fuzz/property tests; scenario coverage; incident runbooks.

7) Track Record
- Archway: ~231 vaults created (agg staked TBD).
- NEAR: MVP development; CosmWasm → NEAR SDK port; deterministic builds/CI tests.
- Tooling: near‑workspaces tests; Actions builds; GPG‑signed releases.
