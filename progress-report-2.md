# SudoStake — Progress Report 2

Date: 2025-09-23  •  Roadmap: sudostake-roadmap-near-mvp.md
Note: This report summarizes current status. For authoritative dates, scope, and execution steps, see sudostake-roadmap-near-mvp.md.

## Summary
- M1 functionally complete ahead of Sep 30 target.
- All M1 features shipped on testnet; counter-offers (amount-only) deferred (time-permitting).
- E2E flows validated: mint → delegate/undelegate → request → accept (amount-only) → repay → claims.
- M2 prereq resolved: near-sdk-rs PR #1369 merged; proceed with optimized path.

## M1 Scope Status
1. Connect NEAR wallet — done
2. Vaults dashboard — done
3. Vault page: deposit/withdraw — done
4. Stake mgmt: delegate/undelegate/claim-unstaked — done
5. Request loan — done
6. Lender accepts request — done
7. Repay before deadline — done
8. Liquidate after missed deadline — done
9. Lender marketplace — done
10. Counter-offers (amount-only) — deferred

## Notes
- Testnet build exercised E2E including claims transitions (liquid → matured unstaked → fallback unstake).
- UX polish tracked separately; does not affect M1 completeness.

## Risks
- None blocking M1. Counter-offers remains optional.
- For M2, proceed behind flags to mitigate integration risk.

## Next (toward M2)
- Start optimized path (target Nov 15, 2025): global Vault, code-hash registry, size/cost baseline with E2E tests.
- Maintain Nov 1 checkpoint; fallback documented, not expected.
