# SudoStake — Business Risk Register (NEAR MVP)

Scope
- Protocol and product risks, including smart contracts and P2P adoption.

R-01 — Smart Contracts Risk  
Action: Commission independent audits before mainnet; publish reports and remediations; run a scoped public bug bounty; add a Risk Disclosures page and in‑app warnings.

R-02 — Liquidity Bootstrapping for USDC Borrowers  
Action: Allocate bootstrap USDC tranches to early deals; secure written partner commitments; add a live dashboard for on‑chain USDC availability and fill rates.

R-03 — Manual, Perpetual Design May Confuse Users  
Action: Add a clear "nothing runs automatically" explainer; show a step‑by‑step checklist (repay, claim) with due times; offer one‑click Auto‑Repay and Auto‑Claim; send reminders; include a simple timeline and "what happens next" examples.

R-04 — Security Reviews Delay Launch  
Action: Book audit slots with buffer; enforce a pre‑audit code freeze; launch testnet → allowlist → open mainnet; start a public bug bounty before mainnet.

R-05 — Fees May Not Cover Costs at Scale  
Action: Publish fee options and rationale; run pricing experiments; implement validator revenue‑share in contracts; maintain and review a runway model quarterly.

R-06 — Perceived Efficiency Trade‑offs vs Oracle‑Based Lending  
Action: Publish a "P2P vs pooled" explainer; add a dashboard for utilization/fill metrics; include case studies where P2P matches/exceeds pools; highlight isolation and deterministic recovery in UI.

R-07 — Expectation Mismatch with Pooled Lending  
Action: Update copy and onboarding to set P2P expectations; include a one‑page model comparison; surface benefits (isolation, predictable recovery) in deal details.
