Scope: Protocol and product risks, including smart contracts and P2P adoption.

R‑01 Smart contracts
- Action: Independent audits before mainnet; publish reports/remediations; scoped public bug bounty; Risk Disclosures page and in‑app warnings.

R‑02 Liquidity bootstrapping (USDC)
- Action: Allocate bootstrap USDC tranches; secure partner commitments; live dashboard for USDC availability and fill rates.

R‑03 Manual/perpetual design confusion
- Action: “Nothing runs automatically” explainer; checklist with due times; one‑click Auto‑Repay/Auto‑Claim; reminders; simple timeline and “what happens next.”

R‑04 Security review delays launch
- Action: Book audits with buffer; pre‑audit code freeze; testnet → allowlist → open mainnet; start public bug bounty pre‑mainnet.

R‑05 Fees vs costs at scale
- Action: Publish fee options/rationale; pricing experiments; validator revenue‑share; quarterly runway review.

R‑06 Efficiency trade‑offs vs oracle‑based lending
- Action: “P2P vs pooled” explainer; utilization/fill dashboard; case studies; emphasize isolation + deterministic recovery.

R‑07 Expectation mismatch vs pooled lending
- Action: Onboarding copy sets P2P expectations; one‑page model comparison; surface isolation/predictable recovery.
