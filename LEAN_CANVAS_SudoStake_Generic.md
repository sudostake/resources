# 🧩 LEAN CANVAS – SudoStake (Chain‑Agnostic)

One‑liner
- Borrow against staked assets without unbonding. User‑owned vaults, deterministic flows, simple integrations.

## 1. Problem

- Stakers must unbond (delay/penalty) to get liquidity, or use risky synthetic wrappers/custody.
- Lenders lack a simple, non‑custodial way to deploy capital against productive on‑chain collateral.

---

## 2. Customer Segments

- Stakers and validators seeking liquidity without unbonding.
- Lenders/treasuries wanting secured yield on stablecoins.
- Wallets, agents, and dApps embedding “Borrow against stake.”

---

## 3. Unique Value Proposition

> Turn staked assets into usable collateral — no unbonding, no custodians, simple rules.

- User‑owned vaults (not pooled).
- Deterministic, oracle‑minimized flow.
- Composable events and interfaces.

---

## 4. Solution

- Vaults: mint a user‑owned smart vault (one‑time fee) to manage stake and balances.
- Borrow/Lend: borrower posts terms; lender accepts via standard token transfer + message.
- Liquidation: anyone can trigger after deadline; transparent, priority‑ordered repayment.
- Integrations: structured events and stable interfaces for wallets/agents.

---

## 5. Channels

- Web app (mint, stake, request/accept/repay, liquidation).
- Agent/wallet integrations (intent‑driven flows).
- Validator, wallet, and community partnerships.

---

## 6. Revenue Streams

- Configurable vault creation fee.
- Optional validator/operator commissions.

---

## 7. Cost Structure

- Protocol engineering, audits, maintenance.
- Frontend, agent, and indexing ops.
- Chain deploys, monitoring, and support.

---

## 8. Key Metrics

- Total value staked (by chain and aggregate).
- Vaults created/active; retention.
- Loan volume, repayment rate, time‑to‑fund.
- Lender liquidity depth and participation.
- Integrations (wallets, agents, protocols).

---

## 9. Unfair Advantage

- Oracle‑minimized, deterministic design.
- User‑owned vaults; no pooled custody.
- Modular adapters for staking, tokens, and events.
